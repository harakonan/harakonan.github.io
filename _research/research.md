[Encouraging Renewable Investment: Risk Sharing Using Auctions](../assets/pdfs/Hara_RenewableRiskSharingAuction.pdf)<br>
<span style="font-size:0.75em"> Widespread investment in renewable energy is seen as a critical tool in mitigating the impacts of climate change. However, renewable energy projects face substantial risk because they sell their electricity into volatile wholesale electricity markets, and this risk may hinder investments that otherwise appear profitable. Policymakers looking to encourage renewable investment can choose between direct subsidies for renewable investment and power purchase agreements that assume the risk of future electricity sales. The relative value of these two approaches depends critically upon investors' risk premium. This paper investigates this trade-off in the context of Brazilian wind energy actions that award winners purchase agreements for a share of their production. I develop and estimate a structural auction model that separately recovers the investors' risk aversion and private costs. I find that investors are substantially risk averse: investors require an additional risk premium of $20.16/MWh to accept the risk of selling all electricity into the wholesale market, where revenues have a standard deviation of $5.44/MWh. For 3% of Brazil's generation capacity auctioned, full share purchase agreements will be expected to cost $20 billion less than subsidies. </span>

[Identification and Estimation of Dynamic Games with Unknown Information Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03706)<br>
(with Yuki Ito and Paul Koh)<br>
<span style="font-size:0.75em"> This paper studies the identification and estimation of dynamic games when the underlying information structure is unknown to the researcher. To tractably characterize the set of Markov perfect equilibrium predictions while maintaining weak assumptions on players' information, we introduce *Markov correlated equilibrium*, a dynamic analog of Bayes correlated equilibrium. The set of Markov correlated equilibrium predictions coincides with the set of Markov perfect equilibrium predictions that can arise when the players can observe more signals than assumed by the analyst. Using Markov correlated equilibrium as the solution concept, we propose tractable computational strategies for informationally robust estimation, inference, and counterfactual analysis that deal with the non-convexities arising in dynamic environments. We use our method to analyze the dynamic competition between Starbucks and Dunkin' in the US and the role of informational assumptions. </span>

## Work in Progress

Primary Care Physician-Specialist Racial Concordance in Forming Referral Networks<br>
(with Yuki Ito)<br>
<span style="font-size:0.75em"> We study the role of racial concordance between primary care physicians and specialists in physician referral network formation and its consequences on racial health disparity. Using a 20% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries in the United States, we find that primary care physicians refer patients to the same race specialists more than otherwise, especially when the patients are also the same race. We propose a structural framework to separately identify the racial concordance effect net of health outcome benefits on referral decisions and the racial concordance effect on health outcomes. </span>

Regulating Power Plant Emissions: Environmental Justice, Enforcement, and Regulator Preferences<br>
(with Gautam Gowrisankaran and Ashley Langer)<br>
<span style="font-size:0.75em"> We develop a structural framework of the interplay between the regulator and coal power plants in the context of dynamic enforcement. Plants invest in pollution abatement technologies in response to the regulator's dynamic enforcement decisions. The regulator faces the trade-off between pollution and fines because heavy fines reduce pollution but harm the local economy. We estimate the regulator's utility function, formulated as the weighted sum of the disutility from pollution and fines, along with the plants' dynamic investment decision model. We use the model to evaluate how enforcement decisions affect the welfare of minority and low-income communities. </span>
